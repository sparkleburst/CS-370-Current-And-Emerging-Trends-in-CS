Pirate Intelligent Agent - README

Project Overview

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent to navigate a maze and find a treasure while avoiding obstacles. The agent employs a reinforcement learning technique called Deep Q-Learning, where a neural network is used to guide the agent's decision-making process based on past experiences.

Provided Code
I was given several foundational code files to start with:

TreasureMaze: This code defined the maze environment, including the maze structure, possible agent actions, and the conditions for winning or losing.
GameExperience: This code handled the experience replay mechanism, storing episodes of agent interactions and retrieving them for training the neural network.

Created Code
I implemented the following:

Deep Q-Learning Algorithm: I created the qtrain function to train the agent using experience replay. This involved exploring the maze, updating the Q-values, and guiding the agent toward the treasure.
Epsilon-Greedy Policy: I implemented a strategy for balancing exploration and exploitation during training, with epsilon decreasing as the agent improved.
Training Visualization: I included logging and visualization features to track the agent's progress and win rate over time.

Computer science involves addressing complex problems using computational techniques. This project exemplifies that approach in several key areas:

Problem-Solving: I applied computational methods to train an agent to navigate a maze, showcasing the critical problem-solving skills central to computer science.
Learning and Adaptation: The project utilized reinforcement learning, illustrating how algorithms can learn from experience and adapt to new environments and challenges.
Interdisciplinary Applications: The ideas explored in this project have wide-ranging applications across multiple fields, including robotics, gaming, and artificial intelligence, underscoring the broad scope of computer science.

Ethical Considerations
As a computer scientist, I must consider the ethical implications of my work. In this project, my responsibilities include:

Safety: Ensuring that the agent's behavior does not pose risks to end users or the system it operates within.
Privacy: Handling any data used in training with care, ensuring confidentiality and proper use.
Fairness: Designing algorithms free from biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.
Transparency: Providing clear explanations and documentation to ensure accountability and maintain trust in the system.
